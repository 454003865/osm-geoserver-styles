# Open Street Map Geoserver CSS 

These files can be used to style up the Open Street Map layers hosted on a Geoserver.  I made these using the CSS
extension for Geoserver.  I attempeted to get the styles (colors, widths, etc) as close to the original OSM data as possible.  However, at this time it is not an exact. It is still a work in progress.  Feel free to adjust the scale thresholds to suit your needs.  

The styles area also used for the large scale, 1:10m [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com// "Title") data set.
