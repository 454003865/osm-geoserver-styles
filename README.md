# omar-geoserver-styles
OMAR Geoserver .css styles for the reference/base
map.

These files can be used to style up the Open Street Map layers hosted on a Geoserver.  I made these using the CSS
extension for Geoserver.  I attempeted to get the styles as close to the original OSM data as possible.  However, at this 
time it is not an exact.  It is still a work in progress.  

The data also uses layers from the 1:10M Natural Earth data set. [an example](http://example.com/ "Title")
